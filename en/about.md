I'm a designer.

I started exploring Web3 in July 2025.  
My first lines of code were written at a codecamp — reading docs, understanding project structure.

Today, working with Cursor, I can ship the basic structure of a website in 3–4 hours.  
(This blog was built with AI in about 3 hours.)

In 2026, I'm convinced tools are redefining capability boundaries.

I collaborate with AI to build systems and solve structural, abstract problems.  
AI amplifies what I can do.

What I care about:

- The logic behind protocols  
- How mechanisms shape behavior  
- How information is structured and understood  

Going forward, I'll continue building Web3 products with AI, researching infrastructure and protocol design, and creating a business powered by capability and systems.

If you're starting from zero,  
if you believe structure beats noise and long-term building matters —  
we might be building in the same direction.
