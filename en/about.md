I'm a designer.

I started exploring Web3 in July 2025. At codecamp I wrote my first code, read docs, and learned to understand project structure.

Today, working with Cursor, I can build the basic structure of a website in 3–4 hours. (This blog was built together in about 3 hours.)

In 2026, I'm increasingly convinced: tools are reshaping the boundaries of capability.

I collaborate with AI to build systems and solve structural, abstract problems. AI amplifies what I can do, and lowers the threshold for expressing ideas.

What I care about:

- The logic behind protocols  
- How mechanisms shape behavior  
- How information is structured and understood  

Going forward, I'll continue building Web3 products with AI, researching infrastructure and protocol frameworks, and building a business powered by capability and systems.

If you're starting from zero, if you believe structure beats noise and long-term building matters over short-term stimulation — perhaps my experience can help you.
