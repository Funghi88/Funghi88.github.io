## 5. Customizing Minima (Current Theme)

Minima is minimal by design. To evolve:

1. **Override CSS:** Create `assets/css/style.scss` in your repo
2. **Custom layout:** Add `_layouts/` and override `home` or `post`
3. **Or switch theme:** Consider [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) (docs-style) or [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) (blog-focused)

Start with small tweaks (font, accent color) before a full redesign.
